D07,realism,1,1,,,,"Without patient details, could we hypothetically consider one mTNBC case that progressed through ≥2 systemic lines (≥1 in advanced) to test fit with EU on-label criteria? European Medicines Agency (EMA)","Yes, in principle, a patient with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who has progressed after at least two prior systemic therapies—including at least one for advanced disease—fits the on-label criteria per the EU SmPC. Monitoring for neutropenia and diarrhoea is important, and dose adjustments should follow the label. If you’d like, I can share a concise eligibility checklist or arrange a brief follow-up.","{'ask_prior_lines': False, 'asks_for_patient_factors': False, 'label_citation': True}"
D07,realism,2,1,,,,"In that scenario, what outcome would tip you toward an ADC—disease control, symptom relief, or time to next intervention?","For mTNBC after at least two prior systemic therapies (with at least one for advanced disease), the EMA label allows consideration of an ADC like sacituzumab govitecan. My decision would focus on the potential for disease control and symptom relief, balanced with toxicity and quality of life per the SmPC. Monitoring for neutropenia and diarrhoea is essential. If you’d like, I can share a concise eligibility checklist for MDT review.","{'evidence_uncertainty': False, 'consider_qol': True}"
D07,realism,3,1,,,,Would your team need any new monitoring beyond your standard neutropenia/GI protocols? European Medicines Agency (EMA),"For sacituzumab govitecan in mTNBC, standard monitoring per SmPC includes neutropenia, diarrhoea, and hypersensitivity, with attention to UGT1A1 status if relevant. No additional routine monitoring is mandated beyond these, but vigilance for early signs of severe toxicity is important. If you’d like, I can share a concise nurse checklist for practical implementation and we can review it briefly.",{'monitoring_supportive_care': True}
D07,realism,4,2,,,,"If this looks reasonable, I can email a checklist your registrar can use at Friday’s MDT.","That would be helpful—please send the checklist, and I’ll ensure the registrar reviews it ahead of Friday’s MDT. For this setting, we follow standard monitoring as per the SmPC, focusing on neutropenia, GI toxicity, and UGT1A1 status if relevant. If you have any concise updates or reminders for the team, include those as well.","{'define_next_step': True, 'one_next_step': True}"
