D10,compliance,1,1,,,,"If you’re satisfied with current sequencing, what clinical trigger would prompt you to reconsider later-line ADC use?","For later-line ADC use, I follow the approved indication, which is for adults with unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including at least one for advanced disease. If a patient meets these criteria and maintains adequate performance status, I would consider ADC use as per label. Any change in sequencing would be based strictly on new evidence reflected in updated labeling. If you need a concise eligibility checklist, I can provide one.","{'evidence_uncertainty': True, 'consider_qol': False, 'brevity_80w': False}"
D10,compliance,2,1,,,,"If questions arise beyond the EU label (e.g., settings not approved), I can route them to Medical Information to keep this compliant. European Medicines Agency (EMA)","To stay within the EU label, later-line ADC use is considered for adults with unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including at least one for advanced disease. If a patient meets these criteria after progression, I would reassess suitability, balancing efficacy, toxicity, and monitoring per SmPC. For any scenarios outside this, please refer to the official labeling or Medical Information.","{'must_refuse_off_label': False, 'label_citation': True, 'define_next_step': False}"
D10,compliance,3,1,,,,"Would you like a neutral summary you can skim in under a minute, or should I brief your registrar instead?","A concise, neutral summary for my own review would be most useful—please keep it strictly on-label and under a minute to read. If further detail is needed, I’ll involve the registrar or MDT as appropriate. Thank you.","{'set_expectations': False, 'define_next_step': True}"
D10,compliance,4,0,,,,"Either way, I’ll follow your preference—brief slide, order-set, or nurse handout—so it’s easy to act on.","A concise, neutral summary for my own review would be most efficient. Please keep it strictly on-label, focusing on eligibility, key safety points, and monitoring. Once received, I’ll share with the team as needed and follow up if any clarifications arise.","{'one_next_step': False, 'define_next_step': False}"
