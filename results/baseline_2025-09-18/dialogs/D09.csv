Each case is reviewed for on-label eligibility, prior therapies, and safety monitoring per SmPC. Access may require pharmacy and payer approval, so early coordination is helpful. If you have a concise checklist or access summary, please share it and we can arrange a brief follow-up with our pharmacy team.",{'define_next_step': True}
D09,sales_training,2,2,,,,Any prior-authorisation or therapeutic committee requirements where a concise EU-label summary would help? European Medicines Agency (EMA),"For later-line ADCs, including those approved by the EMA, we typically require prior authorisation and a brief submission to our therapeutic committee. A concise EU-label summary is helpful to streamline this process, especially for eligibility and safety monitoring. Please send a one-page summary aligned to the SmPC, and I can confirm if any additional documentation is needed. Let’s arrange a short follow-up once that’s available.","{'label_citation': True, 'define_next_step': True}"

Please send a one-page summary aligned to the SmPC, and I can connect you with our pharmacy and nursing leads for next steps.",{'define_next_step': False}
