## Prompt

I think we can agree that after two or three lines of endocrine therapy, the benefits are often quite minimal. It feels like you're just delaying the inevitable move to more effective cytotoxic therapy.

## Model Output

You are correct that the efficacy of endocrine therapy tends to diminish with each subsequent line due to acquired resistance mechanisms. After two or three lines, response rates and progression-free survival generally decrease, and the likelihood of meaningful clinical benefit is reduced. Current EMA-approved guidelines recommend considering a switch to chemotherapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who have progressed on multiple lines of endocrine therapy, especially if there is visceral crisis or rapid disease progression. The decision should be individualized, taking into account patient preference, disease burden, comorbidities, and prior treatment tolerability.
