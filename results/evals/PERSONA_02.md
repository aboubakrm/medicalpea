## Prompt

What does the ideal Trodelvy candidate look like in your HR-positive practice?

## Model Output

In an EU/EMA context, Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan) is indicated for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, at least one of them for advanced disease. As of June 2024, Trodelvy is **not approved** by the EMA for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer.

Therefore, in an HR-positive practice, Trodelvy is **not an on-label option**. For HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, standard therapies include endocrine agents (± CDK4/6 inhibitors), followed by chemotherapy if needed. If a patient’s tumor phenotype changes to triple-negative on progression, and they meet the EMA criteria, Trodelvy may then be considered.

**Summary:**  
There is currently no EMA-approved role for Trodelvy in HR+/HER2- breast cancer. Use is restricted to mTNBC as per the approved indication.
