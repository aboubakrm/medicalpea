## Prompt

The TROPiCS-02 study showed a 34% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus standard chemotherapy.

## Model Output

Yes, that is correct. The TROPiCS-02 study evaluated sacituzumab govitecan versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy in patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had received prior endocrine therapy and at least two prior chemotherapies. The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS): sacituzumab govitecan reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 34% compared to standard chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53–0.83; p=0.0003). This supports the clinical benefit of sacituzumab govitecan in this patient population.
