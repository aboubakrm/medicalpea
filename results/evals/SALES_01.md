## Prompt

I understand the concern about neutropenia, but it's generally manageable with growth factor support and dose modifications as outlined in the protocol.

## Model Output

You are correct that neutropenia is a common adverse event with many cytotoxic chemotherapies and some targeted agents. According to EMA-approved protocols, neutropenia is typically managed with dose delays, dose reductions, and/or the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) as indicated. It is important to follow the specific recommendations in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for each medicinal product regarding the management of neutropenia, including thresholds for dose modifications and the use of supportive care. Regular monitoring of blood counts is essential to ensure patient safety and optimize treatment efficacy.
