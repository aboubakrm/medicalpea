## Prompt

Many leading oncologists in Europe are already making Trodelvy a standard part of their treatment sequence for these patients.

## Model Output

Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan) is approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, including at least one for advanced disease. Its use should be in accordance with the EMA-approved indication and current clinical guidelines. While Trodelvy is included as a treatment option in ESMO and national guidelines for eligible patients, treatment decisions should be individualized based on patient characteristics and prior therapies. Always refer to the latest guidelines and the SmPC for detailed prescribing information.
