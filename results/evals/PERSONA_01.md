## Prompt

Doctor, for patients who have just progressed on their initial CDK4/6 inhibitor and first-line endocrine therapy, why wait? Wouldn't an effective ADC like Trodelvy be the best option to use right away?

## Model Output

Thank you for your question. In the EU, the standard approach for patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer who progress on first-line endocrine therapy plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor is to continue with further lines of endocrine-based therapy if possible, unless there is visceral crisis or endocrine resistance. This is based on evidence that many patients can still benefit from additional endocrine agents (e.g., fulvestrant, exemestane, or combinations with targeted therapies like everolimus or alpelisib for PIK3CA-mutant tumors).

Sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) approved in the EU for HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, but its indication is for patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies in the metastatic setting, with at least one being endocrine-based and one being chemotherapy. Thus, it is not approved for use immediately after progression on first-line CDK4/6 inhibitor plus endocrine therapy.

Early use of Trodelvy is not supported by current EMA-approved indications, and optimal sequencing is important to maximize benefit and manage toxicity. Chemotherapy or ADCs are generally reserved for later lines, after endocrine options are exhausted or if there is rapidly progressive or symptomatic disease.

In summary: ADCs like Trodelvy are effective, but according to EU guidelines and EMA approval, they are not recommended as immediate second-line therapy after first-line CDK4/6 inhibitor plus endocrine therapy. Endocrine-based options remain standard unless there is urgent need for cytotoxic therapy.
