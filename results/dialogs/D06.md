**Turn 1 — Rep:** Is your unit comfortable with Day 1/Day 8 q21d scheduling for ADCs? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**Turn 2 — Rep:** Do your nurses prefer 3 h first infusion then 1–2 h subsequently if tolerated—and ≥30 min observation post-infusion? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For sacituzumab govitecan, we follow the SmPC: Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21-day cycle is the approved schedule. The initial infusion is over 3 hours, with subsequent infusions over 1–2 hours if tolerated, and at least 30 minutes of post-infusion observation. Nursing staff are familiar with this protocol. If you need a concise checklist for infusion monitoring, I can arrange that.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** Any lab-timing constraints for same-day ANC checks that we should factor into the template orders? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For sacituzumab govitecan, the SmPC recommends Day 1 and Day 8 dosing every 21 days, with pre-infusion ANC checks to ensure adequate neutrophil counts. Our unit aligns with this schedule, and same-day ANC results are required before each dose. Coordination with the lab to ensure timely results is important. If you have a draft template, I can review it briefly or suggest a nurse checklist for workflow alignment.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** I can tailor a clinic-ready order set (premeds, labs, holds, observation notes) to your workflow.

**HCP:**
Thank you. For ADCs like sacituzumab govitecan, we follow the SmPC: Day 1 and Day 8 dosing every 21 days, with first infusion over 3 hours, then 1–2 hours if tolerated, and at least 30 minutes observation post-infusion. ANC must be checked before each dose; same-day results are essential to avoid delays. Please send a draft order set for review, and we can arrange a brief follow-up.
