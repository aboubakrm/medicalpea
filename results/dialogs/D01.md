**Turn 1 — Rep:** Dr Tawel, may I take 3–4 minutes to focus on later-line mTNBC options that are on-label in the EU?

**HCP:**
Certainly. For on-label use in the EU, sacituzumab govitecan is indicated for adults with unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including at least one for advanced disease. Monitoring for neutropenia and diarrhoea is important, and dose adjustments may be needed per SmPC. If you’d like, I can share a concise eligibility checklist or arrange a brief follow-up.

**Turn 2 — Rep:** Could you clarify what else you need to keep this strictly on-label?

**HCP:**
To keep this strictly on-label, I only need to confirm the breast cancer subtype (triple-negative) and the number of prior systemic therapies in the metastatic setting. Once you provide these, I can discuss approved use, monitoring, and key safety points. If you don’t have those details now, please send a concise summary and we can arrange a brief follow-up.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** When they progress, what single-agent chemos are your go-to—and what usually triggers a switch (radiographic change, symptoms, toxicity)?

**HCP:**
For later-line mTNBC, single-agent options per label include sacituzumab govitecan, capecitabine, eribulin, and vinorelbine, among others. Choice depends on prior therapies, patient fitness, and toxicity profile. I typically switch therapy for clear radiographic progression or significant symptomatic deterioration; unacceptable toxicity also prompts a change. Monitoring is guided by clinical status and standard imaging. If you have a concise summary of your product’s on-label positioning, please send it and we can arrange a brief follow-up.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** If helpful, we can quickly map our EU SmPC regimen (D1/D8 q21d) to your clinic flow and discuss practical safety steps your team already uses. European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
Thank you. For later-line mTNBC, I consider agents like capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine, guided by prior therapies, toxicity, and patient preference. I typically switch on clear radiographic progression or significant symptomatic or toxicity burden. For any new regimen, including D1/D8 q21d schedules, we prioritise neutropenia and diarrhoea monitoring per SmPC. If you have a concise checklist, I’m happy to review it with our nursing team.
