# Dialog D04 (realism)

**Turn 1 — Rep:** For later-line ADCs, how do you risk-stratify for febrile neutropenia and decide on primary G-CSF in cycle 1? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For sacituzumab govitecan, the SmPC notes a significant risk of neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis in cycle 1 is not mandated for all, but should be considered in patients with additional risk factors (e.g., age, comorbidities, prior neutropenia). Monitoring full blood counts before each dose is essential. For detailed criteria, please refer to the SmPC; we can review a concise risk checklist together at your convenience.

**Turn 2 — Rep:** Do you use fixed ANC thresholds to hold Day 1 (<1500/mm³) or Day 8 (<1000/mm³) doses? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For sacituzumab govitecan, the SmPC recommends holding Day 1 dosing if ANC is below 1.5 × 10⁹/L and Day 8 if below 1.0 × 10⁹/L. Febrile neutropenia risk is managed by monitoring counts and clinical status; primary G-CSF is not routine but may be considered in high-risk patients per label. Please refer to the SmPC for full guidance, and we can review a monitoring checklist if helpful.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** If your protocol differs, I can align our dose-mod grid to your thresholds for easy cross-walk. European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
I follow the SmPC guidance for neutrophil thresholds: treatment should not be started if ANC is below 1.5 × 10⁹/L on Day 1 or below 1.0 × 10⁹/L on Day 8. Dose modifications and delays are based on these values. For G-CSF, I consider prior neutropenia, comorbidities, and institutional protocols, but always within label. If you have a concise dose-modification grid, please send it and we can review alignment in a brief follow-up.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** Would a laminated safety card (holds/reductions + G-CSF prompts) be helpful for chair-side reference?

**HCP:**
A concise, laminated safety card summarising dose holds, reductions, and G-CSF prompts per SmPC could be useful for chair-side reference, especially for nursing staff. Please ensure it strictly reflects the approved thresholds and guidance from the SmPC. If you send a draft, I can review it for alignment with our protocols before wider use.
