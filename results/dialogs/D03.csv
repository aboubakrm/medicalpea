D03,compliance,1,2,,,,Would a two-minute overview of the EU-label clinical evidence vs single-agent chemo help frame later-line decisions? European Medicines Agency (EMA),"I can only discuss the approved use as described in the SmPC, not comparative claims beyond the label. The EU indication is for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including at least one for advanced disease. If you need a concise summary of the labeled evidence and safety profile, I can provide that or suggest a brief follow-up.","{'avoid_unverified_claims': False, 'label_citation': True, 'brevity_80w': True}"
D03,compliance,2,2,,,,"Are PFS/OS the endpoints you prioritise most in this setting, or do you weigh symptom control and time to QoL deterioration more?","For later-line metastatic breast cancer, I consider PFS and OS as key endpoints per the label, but symptom control and time to QoL deterioration are also important in daily practice. The SmPC reflects the evidence for efficacy and safety, but individual patient priorities and tolerability guide real-world decisions. If you have a concise summary of the approved data, please send it, and we can arrange a brief follow-up.","{'consider_qol': True, 'evidence_uncertainty': True}"
D03,compliance,3,3,,,,"If you prefer, I can keep it high-level today and share a one-pager for later review.","A high-level summary is fine. For later-line metastatic breast cancer, I consider PFS and OS as key endpoints, but symptom control and quality of life are also important, especially given the toxicity profile of available agents. Please send the one-pager, and we can arrange a brief follow-up if needed.","{'define_next_step': True, 'one_next_step': True, 'set_expectations': True}"
D03,compliance,4,2,,,,"If you’d like to go deeper another time, we can set up a short in-service specifically for your current patient cohort.","A concise one-pager is most useful for my review, as I prioritise efficiency and patient relevance. For any in-depth discussion, I’d need to ensure it remains strictly on-label and focused on approved indications. Please send the summary, and if needed, we can arrange a brief follow-up to address any specific, label-aligned questions.","{'define_next_step': True, 'one_next_step': True}"
