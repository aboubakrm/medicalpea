D08,realism,1,1,,,,"For HR+/HER2– patients post endocrine-based therapy with ≥2 additional systemic therapies in the advanced setting, how do you pick the next line? European Medicines Agency (EMA)","For HR+/HER2– metastatic breast cancer after endocrine-based therapy and at least two prior systemic treatments for advanced disease, options should align with the SmPC. Sacituzumab govitecan is approved in this setting. Choice depends on prior regimens, patient fitness, and toxicity profile. Monitor for neutropenia and diarrhoea per label. If you’d like, I can share a concise eligibility checklist or arrange a brief follow-up to review practical steps.","{'sequencing_endocrine_bias': False, 'evidence_uncertainty': True}"
D08,realism,2,0,,,,Could you clarify what else you need to keep this strictly on-label?,"Thank you. To keep this strictly on-label, I only need to confirm the subtype (HR+/HER2–, as you stated) and the number and type of prior systemic therapies in the advanced/metastatic setting. If the patient has received endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic treatments for advanced disease, we can discuss approved options and monitoring. If you have a concise summary, please send it and we can arrange a brief follow-up.","{'sequencing_endocrine_bias': False, 'consider_qol': False}"
D08,realism,3,1,,,,"Would a quick side-by-side of practicalities (infusion time, dose-mods, monitoring) be useful for your clinic pathway?","To keep this strictly on-label, I only need to confirm the subtype (HR+/HER2–, as you stated) and that the patient has received prior endocrine-based therapy plus at least two additional systemic treatments for advanced disease. If these are met, I can discuss approved use, practicalities, and monitoring per the SmPC. Please send a concise summary, and we can arrange a brief follow-up to align on clinic workflow.",{'monitoring_supportive_care': True}
D08,realism,4,2,,,,"If yes, I’ll tailor it to your day-case capacity and pharmacy prep windows.","Yes, a concise, on-label summary of infusion logistics, dose modifications, and monitoring would be helpful for our day-case workflow. Please keep it brief and strictly within the SmPC. Once you send that, we can review it with our nursing and pharmacy teams and arrange a short follow-up if needed.","{'define_next_step': True, 'one_next_step': True}"
