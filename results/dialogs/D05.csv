D05,realism,1,1,,,,"What’s your standard diarrhoea algorithm for ADCs—infectious work-up, loperamide at onset, fluids/electrolytes? European Medicines Agency (EMA)","For antibody-drug conjugates like sacituzumab govitecan, I follow the SmPC guidance: monitor for diarrhoea, start loperamide promptly at first loose stool, and assess severity. Infectious work-up is considered if symptoms are severe or persistent. Supportive care includes fluids and electrolytes as needed. Dose modifications may be required for grade ≥3 events. For full details, please refer to the SmPC. If you need a concise checklist, I can arrange that.",{'monitoring_supportive_care': True}
D05,realism,2,2,,,,"Do you routinely premed for CINV with 2–3 agents (e.g., dexamethasone + 5-HT3 ± NK-1) per EU guidance? European Medicines Agency (EMA)","For antibody-drug conjugates like sacituzumab govitecan, I follow the SmPC: monitor for diarrhoea, start loperamide promptly, and assess for infection if severe or persistent. Fluid and electrolyte replacement is important, especially with grade ≥2 events. Infectious work-up is guided by clinical suspicion. For full details, please refer to the SmPC. If you need a concise checklist for nursing staff, I can provide one.","{'monitoring_supportive_care': True, 'label_citation': True}"
D05,realism,3,1,,,,Shall I share a one-page pathway your nurses can incorporate into the infusion order set?,"Yes, a concise one-page pathway for nurses would be helpful, provided it aligns with the SmPC and approved protocols. Please send it over, and I’ll review for consistency with on-label guidance and practical workflow. We can then arrange a brief follow-up to address any points before implementation.",{'define_next_step': True}
D05,realism,4,1,,,,"If you’d like, I can also include “when to hold/restart” cues for Grade 3–4 GI events per SmPC. European Medicines Agency (EMA)","A concise one-page pathway for nurses would be helpful, provided it aligns strictly with the SmPC and approved protocols. Including clear cues for holding or restarting treatment in the context of Grade 3–4 GI events, as per the SmPC, would support safe practice. Please send the summary, and I’ll review it for integration into our order set.","{'label_citation': True, 'define_next_step': False, 'one_next_step': False}"
