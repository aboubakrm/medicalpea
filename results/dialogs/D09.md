**Turn 1 — Rep:** From an access/formulary angle, are there specific steps we should navigate for later-line ADCs at your centre?

**HCP:**
For later-line antibody-drug conjugates, we follow standard hospital formulary and MDT protocols. Each case is reviewed for on-label eligibility, prior therapies, and safety monitoring per SmPC. Access may require pharmacy and payer approval, so early coordination is helpful. If you have a concise checklist or access summary, please share it and we can arrange a brief follow-up with our pharmacy team.

**Turn 2 — Rep:** Any prior-authorisation or therapeutic committee requirements where a concise EU-label summary would help? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For later-line ADCs, including those approved by the EMA, we typically require prior authorisation and a brief submission to our therapeutic committee. A concise EU-label summary is helpful to streamline this process, especially for eligibility and safety monitoring. Please send a one-page summary aligned to the SmPC, and I can confirm if any additional documentation is needed. Let’s arrange a short follow-up once that’s available.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** If your institution needs a nurse in-service or order-set endorsement, I can coordinate with your leads.

**HCP:**
A concise EU-label summary is helpful for our therapeutic committee review and for order-set updates. Prior authorisation is typically required for later-line ADCs, and a nurse in-service can support safe administration and monitoring. Please send a one-page summary aligned to the SmPC, and I can connect you with our pharmacy and nursing leads for next steps.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** Happy to provide a one-page dossier (SmPC excerpts + local workflow mapping) for your internal review. European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
A concise SmPC-based summary and local workflow mapping would be helpful for our internal review and any required order-set updates. If a nurse in-service is needed, I’ll coordinate with our leads. Please send the one-page dossier, and we can arrange a brief follow-up to address any specific access or committee queries.
