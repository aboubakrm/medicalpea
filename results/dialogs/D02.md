# Dialog D02 (realism)

**Turn 1 — Rep:** I’ll be brief—could we focus on pre-treated HR+/HER2– mBC that is on-label in the EU?

**HCP:**
Yes, sacituzumab govitecan is approved in the EU for adults with unresectable or metastatic HR+/HER2– breast cancer who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including endocrine therapy and at least one line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Monitoring for neutropenia and diarrhoea is important. If you need a concise eligibility checklist or wish to discuss practical implementation, I’m happy to arrange a brief follow-up.

**Turn 2 — Rep:** Could you clarify what else you need to keep this strictly on-label?

**HCP:**
To keep this strictly on-label, I only need to confirm the number of prior systemic therapies in the metastatic setting. Once that’s clear, I can outline approved use, monitoring, and key safety points. If you have that information, please share it; otherwise, we can arrange a brief follow-up once available.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** After CDK4/6 + endocrine failure, how do you typically sequence later-line chemo?

**HCP:**
To keep this strictly on-label, I need to confirm the number of prior systemic therapies for advanced disease, as the label specifies use after at least two prior lines, including endocrine-based therapy. Once that’s clear, I can outline approved use, monitoring, and key safety points. If you send a concise summary, we can arrange a brief follow-up to ensure alignment.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** Would a quick checklist (eligibility + regimen timing + common dose-mods) be useful for your fellows and nurses?

**HCP:**
Yes, a concise checklist covering eligibility, regimen schedule, and key dose modifications would be practical for the team. It helps ensure on-label use, supports safe administration, and streamlines monitoring for toxicity. Please send a one-page summary, and we can review it briefly at our next team meeting.
