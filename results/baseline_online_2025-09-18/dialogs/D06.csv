D06,experience,1,2,,,,Is your unit comfortable with Day 1/Day 8 q21d scheduling for ADCs? European Medicines Agency (EMA),"For sacituzumab govitecan, the approved schedule per SmPC is Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21-day cycle. Our unit follows this regimen as standard, with monitoring for neutropenia and diarrhoea as outlined in the label. Dose modifications are made according to toxicity and SmPC guidance. If you need a concise checklist for safe administration, I can provide one or arrange a brief follow-up.","{'set_expectations': True, 'monitoring_supportive_care': True}"
D06,experience,2,1,,,,Do your nurses prefer 3 h first infusion then 1–2 h subsequently if tolerated—and ≥30 min observation post-infusion? European Medicines Agency (EMA),"For sacituzumab govitecan, we follow the SmPC: Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21-day cycle is the approved schedule. Infusion times and post-infusion observation are also per label—first infusion over 3 hours, then 1–2 hours if tolerated, with at least 30 minutes observation after each. Nursing teams are familiar with this protocol. If you need a concise checklist for staff, I can arrange that.","{'monitoring_supportive_care': False, 'label_citation': True}"
D06,experience,3,0,,,,Any lab-timing constraints for same-day ANC checks that we should factor into the template orders? European Medicines Agency (EMA),"For sacituzumab govitecan, we follow the Day 1 and Day 8 every 21 days schedule as per the SmPC. First infusion is over 3 hours, then 1–2 hours if tolerated, with at least 30 minutes observation post-infusion—this aligns with our nursing protocols. For ANC, same-day checks before dosing are standard; results must be available before administration to ensure safety. If you have a concise checklist, please share and we can review it together.",{'monitoring_supportive_care': False}
D06,experience,4,2,,,,"I can tailor a clinic-ready order set (premeds, labs, holds, observation notes) to your workflow.","Thank you. For ADCs like sacituzumab govitecan, we follow the SmPC: Day 1 and Day 8 every 21 days, with first infusion over 3 hours, then 1–2 hours if tolerated, and at least 30 minutes observation post-infusion. ANC must be checked before each dose; same-day results are essential to avoid delays. Please send a draft order set for review, and we can arrange a brief follow-up to finalise.","{'define_next_step': True, 'one_next_step': True}"
