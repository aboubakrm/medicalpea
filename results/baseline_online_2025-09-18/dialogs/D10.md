# Dialog D10 (compliance)

**Turn 1 — Rep:** If you’re satisfied with current sequencing, what clinical trigger would prompt you to reconsider later-line ADC use?

**HCP:**
For later-line ADC use, I follow the approved indication, which is for adults with unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including at least one for advanced disease. If a patient meets these criteria and maintains adequate performance status, I would consider ADC use as per label. If you’d like, we can review a concise eligibility checklist together at your convenience.

**Turn 2 — Rep:** If questions arise beyond the EU label (e.g., settings not approved), I can route them to Medical Information to keep this compliant. European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
To stay within the EU label, later-line ADC use is considered for adults with unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including at least one for advanced disease. If a patient meets these criteria and progresses, I would review suitability based on performance status and comorbidities. For any scenarios outside the approved indication, please refer to the SmPC or contact Medical Information.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** Would you like a neutral summary you can skim in under a minute, or should I brief your registrar instead?

**HCP:**
A concise, neutral summary for my own review would be most useful—please keep it strictly on-label and under a minute to read. If it’s relevant for the team, I’ll share it with the registrar as needed. Thank you.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** Either way, I’ll follow your preference—brief slide, order-set, or nurse handout—so it’s easy to act on.

**HCP:**
A concise, neutral summary for my own review would be most efficient. Please keep it strictly on-label, focusing on eligibility, dosing, and key monitoring points. Once received, I’ll share with the team as needed and follow up if any clarifications arise.
