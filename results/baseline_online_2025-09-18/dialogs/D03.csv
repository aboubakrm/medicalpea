D03,compliance,1,2,,,,Would a two-minute overview of the EU-label clinical evidence vs single-agent chemo help frame later-line decisions? European Medicines Agency (EMA),"I can only discuss the approved use as described in the SmPC, not comparative claims beyond the label. For later-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, the EU label is based on evidence versus single-agent chemotherapy, with efficacy and safety outlined in the official product information. If you need a concise summary of the labeled indication and monitoring, I can provide that or suggest a brief follow-up.","{'avoid_unverified_claims': False, 'label_citation': True, 'brevity_80w': True}"
D03,compliance,2,2,,,,"Are PFS/OS the endpoints you prioritise most in this setting, or do you weigh symptom control and time to QoL deterioration more?","For later-line metastatic breast cancer, I consider PFS and OS as key endpoints, but symptom control and time to QoL deterioration are also important, especially given the palliative intent. The label reflects these priorities, balancing efficacy with tolerability. Ultimately, treatment choice should align with both clinical benefit and patient quality of life. If you have a concise summary of the approved data, please send it and we can arrange a brief follow-up.","{'consider_qol': True, 'evidence_uncertainty': True}"
D03,compliance,3,3,,,,"If you prefer, I can keep it high-level today and share a one-pager for later review.","A concise, high-level summary is best for now. For later-line metastatic breast cancer, I consider PFS and OS as key endpoints, but symptom control and quality of life are also important, especially given the toxicity profile. Please send the one-pager, and we can arrange a brief follow-up if needed.","{'define_next_step': True, 'one_next_step': True, 'set_expectations': True}"
D03,compliance,4,2,,,,"If youâ€™d like to go deeper another time, we can set up a short in-service specifically for your current patient cohort.","A concise one-pager is most useful for my workflow, as I prioritise on-label, patient-relevant information. For later-line metastatic breast cancer, I consider PFS, OS, and symptom control, but always within the context of the approved indication and safety profile. If you have a summary aligned to the SmPC, please send it, and we can arrange a brief follow-up if needed.","{'define_next_step': True, 'one_next_step': True}"
