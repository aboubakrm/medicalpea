D01,experience,1,2,,,,"Dr Tawel, may I take 3–4 minutes to focus on later-line mTNBC options that are on-label in the EU?","Certainly. For on-label use in the EU, I need to confirm the patient has metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) and has received at least two prior systemic therapies, including at least one for advanced disease. If you can confirm these points, I’m happy to discuss approved options, key safety considerations, and monitoring. If details aren’t to hand, please send a concise summary and we can arrange a brief follow-up.","{'brevity_80w': True, 'redirect_to_relevant': True}"
D01,experience,2,2,,,,Could you clarify what else you need to keep this strictly on-label?,"To keep this strictly on-label, I only need to confirm the breast cancer subtype (triple-negative status) and the number of prior systemic therapy lines in the metastatic setting. Once you provide those, I can discuss approved options, monitoring, and key safety points. If you don’t have those details now, please send a concise summary and we can arrange a brief follow-up.","{'brevity_80w': True, 'set_expectations': True}"
D01,experience,3,0,,,,"When they progress, what single-agent chemos are your go-to—and what usually triggers a switch (radiographic change, symptoms, toxicity)?","To keep this strictly on-label, I need to confirm the breast cancer subtype (e.g., triple-negative) and the number of prior systemic therapy lines in the metastatic setting. Once those are clear, I can discuss approved options and monitoring. If you can provide that, we’ll keep the discussion focused and clinically relevant. Otherwise, please send a concise summary and we can arrange a brief follow-up.","{'consider_qol': False, 'evidence_uncertainty': False}"
D01,experience,4,4,,,,"If helpful, we can quickly map our EU SmPC regimen (D1/D8 q21d) to your clinic flow and discuss practical safety steps your team already uses. European Medicines Agency (EMA)","Thank you. For later-line mTNBC, I consider agents like capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine, chosen based on prior therapies, toxicity profiles, and patient preference. I typically switch therapy for clear radiographic progression, new or worsening symptoms, or unacceptable toxicity. Safety monitoring and dose adjustments are guided by the SmPC. If you have a concise checklist for the D1/D8 q21d regimen, please share it and we can review practical steps in a brief follow-up.","{'label_citation': True, 'monitoring_supportive_care': True, 'define_next_step': True, 'one_next_step': True}"
