**Turn 1 — Rep:** I’ll be brief—could we focus on pre-treated HR+/HER2– mBC that is on-label in the EU?

**HCP:**
Yes, sacituzumab govitecan is approved in the EU for adults with unresectable or metastatic HR+/HER2– breast cancer who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including endocrine therapy and at least one line of chemotherapy. Monitoring for neutropenia and diarrhoea is important, and dose adjustments should follow the SmPC. If you need a concise eligibility checklist, I can provide one for your team.

**Turn 2 — Rep:** Could you clarify what else you need to keep this strictly on-label?

**HCP:**
To keep this strictly on-label, I only need to confirm the number of prior systemic therapies in the metastatic setting, as well as that the patient is ER-positive, HER2-negative. Once those are clear, I can outline approved use, monitoring, and key safety points. If you have those details, we can proceed; otherwise, please send a concise summary and we’ll arrange a brief follow-up.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** After CDK4/6 + endocrine failure, how do you typically sequence later-line chemo?

**HCP:**
To keep this strictly on-label, I need to confirm the number of prior systemic therapies for advanced disease, as the label specifies use after at least two prior lines, including endocrine-based therapy and at least one chemotherapy. Once that’s clear, we can discuss approved use, monitoring, and quality of life considerations. If you send a concise summary, we can arrange a brief follow-up.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** Would a quick checklist (eligibility + regimen timing + common dose-mods) be useful for your fellows and nurses?

**HCP:**
Yes, a concise checklist covering eligibility, regimen schedule, and key dose modifications would be practical for the team. For HR+/HER2– mBC post-endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor failure, Trodelvy is on-label after at least two prior systemic therapies for advanced disease. Monitoring for neutropenia and diarrhoea per SmPC is important. Please send a one-page summary, and we can arrange a brief follow-up if needed.
