**Turn 1 — Rep:** For later-line ADCs, how do you risk-stratify for febrile neutropenia and decide on primary G-CSF in cycle 1? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For sacituzumab govitecan, the SmPC notes a significant risk of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, especially in later-line metastatic breast cancer. Risk stratification should follow standard clinical factors—age, comorbidities, prior neutropenia, and baseline counts. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis in cycle 1 is not mandated by the label but may be considered for high-risk patients per clinical judgment. Monitoring blood counts closely is essential. For full guidance, please refer to the SmPC. If you need a concise checklist, I can provide one.

**Turn 2 — Rep:** Do you use fixed ANC thresholds to hold Day 1 (<1500/mm³) or Day 8 (<1000/mm³) doses? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For sacituzumab govitecan, the SmPC recommends holding Day 1 dosing if ANC is below 1.5 × 10⁹/L and Day 8 if below 1.0 × 10⁹/L. These thresholds are used to minimise neutropenia risk. Febrile neutropenia risk is managed by monitoring counts and clinical status; primary G-CSF is not routine but may be considered in high-risk patients per label. For further details, please refer to the SmPC. If you need a concise checklist, I can provide one.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** If your protocol differs, I can align our dose-mod grid to your thresholds for easy cross-walk. European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
I follow the SmPC guidance for neutrophil thresholds: treatment should not be given if ANC is below 1.5 × 10⁹/L on Day 1 or below 1.0 × 10⁹/L on Day 8. For febrile neutropenia risk, I assess patient factors and prior history, but primary G-CSF is not routine unless risk is high per label. If you have a concise dose-modification grid, please send it and we can review alignment in a brief follow-up.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** Would a laminated safety card (holds/reductions + G-CSF prompts) be helpful for chair-side reference?

**HCP:**
A concise, laminated safety card summarising dose holds, reductions, and G-CSF prompts per SmPC would be practical for chair-side use. It should reflect the on-label ANC thresholds and monitoring guidance. Please ensure it aligns strictly with the approved product information. If you send a draft, I can review it with our nursing team and suggest any adjustments needed for local workflow.
