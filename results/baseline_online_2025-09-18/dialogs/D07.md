# Dialog D07 (realism)

**Turn 1 — Rep:** Without patient details, could we hypothetically consider one mTNBC case that progressed through ≥2 systemic lines (≥1 in advanced) to test fit with EU on-label criteria? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
Yes, in principle, a patient with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who has progressed after at least two prior systemic therapies (with at least one for advanced disease) fits the on-label criteria per the EU SmPC. Monitoring for neutropenia and diarrhoea is essential, and dose adjustments should follow the label. For practical application, I recommend using a concise eligibility checklist and reviewing with the MDT if needed.

**Turn 2 — Rep:** In that scenario, what outcome would tip you toward an ADC—disease control, symptom relief, or time to next intervention?

**HCP:**
For patients with mTNBC who have progressed after at least two systemic therapies (with at least one for advanced disease), the on-label goal with an ADC like sacituzumab govitecan is to achieve disease control and symptom relief, aiming to delay further progression. Quality of life and manageable toxicity are also important. Monitoring per SmPC is essential. If you’d like, I can share a concise eligibility checklist for MDT review.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** Would your team need any new monitoring beyond your standard neutropenia/GI protocols? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For sacituzumab govitecan in mTNBC, standard monitoring per SmPC includes neutropenia, diarrhoea, and hypersensitivity, with attention to UGT1A1 status if relevant. No additional monitoring is mandated beyond these protocols, but vigilance for early signs of severe toxicity is important. If you’d like, I can share a concise nurse checklist for practical implementation and we can arrange a brief follow-up.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** If this looks reasonable, I can email a checklist your registrar can use at Friday’s MDT.

**HCP:**
That’s reasonable—please send the checklist. For mTNBC after at least two prior systemic therapies, use aligns with the EU label. Standard monitoring per SmPC focuses on neutropenia, diarrhoea, and supportive care; no additional protocols are required unless specific comorbidities exist. We’ll review the checklist at Friday’s MDT and address any case-specific points then.
