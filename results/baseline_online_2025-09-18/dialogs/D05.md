**Turn 1 — Rep:** What’s your standard diarrhoea algorithm for ADCs—infectious work-up, loperamide at onset, fluids/electrolytes? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For antibody-drug conjugates like sacituzumab govitecan, I follow the SmPC guidance. At diarrhoea onset, loperamide is recommended, with prompt assessment for infectious causes if severe or persistent. Monitor hydration and electrolytes closely, and consider dose modifications per label if toxicity is significant. For full details, please refer to the SmPC. If you need a concise checklist for nursing staff, I can provide one.

**Turn 2 — Rep:** Do you routinely premed for CINV with 2–3 agents (e.g., dexamethasone + 5-HT3 ± NK-1) per EU guidance? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For antibody-drug conjugates like sacituzumab govitecan, I follow the SmPC: monitor for diarrhoea, start loperamide promptly, and assess for infection if severe or persistent. Fluid and electrolyte replacement is important, especially with grade ≥2 symptoms. Infectious work-up is guided by clinical suspicion. For CINV, I use antiemetic prophylaxis per local protocols and SmPC, typically a 5-HT3 antagonist with or without dexamethasone. If you need a concise checklist, I can provide one.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** Shall I share a one-page pathway your nurses can incorporate into the infusion order set?

**HCP:**
Yes, a concise one-page pathway for nurses to incorporate into the infusion order set would be helpful, provided it aligns strictly with the approved SmPC and on-label supportive care recommendations. Please send it over, and I’ll review for consistency with our protocols and the product labeling before implementation.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** If you’d like, I can also include “when to hold/restart” cues for Grade 3–4 GI events per SmPC. European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
A concise one-page pathway for the nursing team would be helpful, provided it stays strictly within the SmPC guidance. Including clear cues for holding or restarting in the context of Grade 3–4 GI events, as per the label, would support safe practice. Please send the summary, and I’ll review it for integration into our order set.
