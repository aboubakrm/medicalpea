D09,sales_training,1,1,,,,"From an access/formulary angle, are there specific steps we should navigate for later-line ADCs at your centre?","For later-line antibody-drug conjugates, we follow standard hospital formulary and MDT protocols, ensuring use aligns with the approved SmPC. Access typically requires documentation of prior therapies and on-label eligibility. If you have a concise checklist or summary of local requirements, please share it, and I can review with our pharmacy and MDT leads. For any access barriers, a brief follow-up can be arranged.",{'define_next_step': True}

European Medicines Agency (EMA),"For later-line antibody-drug conjugates, our centre typically requires prior authorisation and review by the therapeutic committee, especially for newer agents. A concise EU-label summary is helpful to streamline this process and ensure alignment with approved indications. Please send a one-page summary referencing the EMA label, and I can confirm if any additional documentation is needed for our formulary pathway.","{'label_citation': True, 'define_next_step': False}"

Prior authorisation is typically required, and clear documentation of on-label criteria streamlines approval. If a nurse in-service is needed, please send a brief outline and I can connect you with our nursing lead for scheduling. Let’s align on a one-page checklist and arrange a short follow-up.",{'define_next_step': True}

For later-line ADCs, we typically need prior authorisation and therapeutic committee approval, so clear EU-label alignment is important. Please send the one-page dossier, and I can coordinate with our pharmacy and nursing leads for any in-service or endorsement needs.
