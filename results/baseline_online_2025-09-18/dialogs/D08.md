**Turn 1 — Rep:** For HR+/HER2– patients post endocrine-based therapy with ≥2 additional systemic therapies in the advanced setting, how do you pick the next line? European Medicines Agency (EMA)

**HCP:**
For HR+/HER2– metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed after endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic treatments, options are limited. Sacituzumab govitecan is approved in this setting. Selection should consider prior toxicities, performance status, and comorbidities. Monitoring for neutropenia and diarrhoea is important per SmPC. If you’d like, I can share a concise eligibility checklist or arrange a brief follow-up to discuss practical implementation.

**Turn 2 — Rep:** Could you clarify what else you need to keep this strictly on-label?

**HCP:**
Thank you. To keep this strictly on-label, I only need to confirm the subtype (HR+/HER2–, as you stated) and that the patient has received endocrine-based therapy plus at least two additional systemic treatments for advanced disease. If both are met, we can discuss approved use, monitoring, and safety per the SmPC. If you have a concise summary, please send it and we can arrange a brief follow-up.

**Turn 3 — Rep:** Would a quick side-by-side of practicalities (infusion time, dose-mods, monitoring) be useful for your clinic pathway?

**HCP:**
To keep this strictly on-label, I only need to confirm the subtype (HR+/HER2–) and that the patient has received prior endocrine-based therapy plus at least two additional systemic treatments for advanced disease. If these are met, a concise side-by-side of infusion logistics, dose modifications, and monitoring per SmPC would be practical. Please send a one-page summary and we can arrange a brief follow-up.

**Turn 4 — Rep:** If yes, I’ll tailor it to your day-case capacity and pharmacy prep windows.

**HCP:**
Yes, a concise, on-label summary of infusion logistics, dose modifications, and monitoring would be helpful for our day-case workflow. Please keep it brief and strictly aligned to the SmPC, focusing on practical steps for nursing and pharmacy. Once you send that, we can review it with our team and arrange a short follow-up if needed.
