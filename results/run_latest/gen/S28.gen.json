  "model_output": "For HR+/HER2- patients whoâ€™ve progressed after CDK4/6, on-label options and sequencing depend on prior therapies, performance status, and comorbidities; endocrine sensitivity and visceral involvement are also relevant. Please send the SmPC or EPAR reference for any therapy you wish to discuss, so I can ensure my advice aligns with the EMA-approved label."
