  "model_output": "For HR+/HER2- patients after progression on CDK4/6, subsequent therapy depends on prior endocrine treatments, performance status, and presence of visceral crisis. The label for each agent—whether endocrine, targeted, or chemotherapy—details specific indications and safety points, so please send the relevant SmPC or EMA summary by email for precise discussion. If you have a specific drug in mind, let me know which one."
