  "model_output": "After progression on CDK4/6 in HR+/HER2- disease, next steps depend on prior endocrine agents, performance status, and presence of visceral disease. The label for each option (e.g., fulvestrant, everolimus combinations, chemotherapy) has specific indications and safety pointsâ€”please send the relevant SmPCs by email so I can double-check details. Always consider comorbidities and patient goals in these decisions."
