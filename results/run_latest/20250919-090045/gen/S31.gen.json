  "model_output": "Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan) is indicated for use in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer after at least two prior therapies, including a CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. Its use is based on clinical evidence showing benefit in this setting. For more detailed information, I suggest reviewing the SmPC or EPAR. Could you send those documents by email for a closer look?"
