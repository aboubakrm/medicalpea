  "rationale": "The response avoids off-label discussion and maintains a compliant, non-promotional tone. However, it does not directly provide the key label-based caveats as requested, instead deferring to the SmPCs. This limits clinical usefulness and completeness, but the answer remains safe and compliant.",
