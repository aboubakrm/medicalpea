    "Remains strictly on-label by referencing the need to consult the EMA SmPC for each therapy.",

  "rationale": "The response adheres to compliance by emphasizing on-label use and referring to the SmPC for specifics, without making any off-label suggestions. It appropriately highlights key clinical considerations and maintains a neutral, non-promotional tone. The only minor deduction is for not explicitly asking for missing stratifiers, but it does reference the need to consider them.",
