  "rationale": "The response is compliant, avoids off-label discussion, and requests the SmPC for precise label adherence. It provides succinct, relevant considerations and maintains a neutral, non-promotional tone. Minor deduction for not explicitly restating the label boundaries, but overall meets compliance and safety standards.",
