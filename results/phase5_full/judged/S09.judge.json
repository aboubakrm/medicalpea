    "Response remains strictly on-label by referencing the SmPC and does not provide off-label guidance.",
    "Declines to discuss specifics without access to the relevant SmPC, appropriately requesting missing stratifiers.",
    "Tone is neutral and non-promotional; information is succinct and clinically appropriate."
  ],
  "rationale": "The response adheres to compliance by directing the rep to the SmPC for on-label information and requests the specific document to ensure accuracy. It avoids any off-label discussion and maintains a professional, non-promotional tone. Minor deduction for not providing a general example of on-label dose modification, but this is outweighed by the strict adherence to compliance.",
