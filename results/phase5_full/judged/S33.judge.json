  "rationale": "The response is compliant, avoids off-label discussion, and appropriately requests clarification for product-specific advice. It is succinct, clinically relevant, and maintains a neutral tone. Minor improvement could be made by more explicitly stating the need to avoid off-label use, but the current response is sufficient for a passing score.",
